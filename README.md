# Cold-Email-Generator
Generate cold email based on Job links tailored to your profile and tech stack using lang chanin, groq, streamlit and chromadb. It allows users to input the URL of a company's careers page. The tool then extracts job listings from that page and generates personalized cold emails. These emails include relevant github links sourced from a vector database, based on the specific job descriptions.
